			<h1>Compare Home Insurance</h1>
			
			<p>When it comes to home insurance, not every carrier can offer the package you've been searching for. That's why it's important to cast the net wide. But before you go calling around to every local agent, make sure you know what factors to compare. The more you know about the typical home insurance policy, the easier it is to size up your options.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Most standard insurance plans will offer six basic coverage types: dwelling, other structures, personal property, loss of use, personal liability protection and medical payments. If you're searching for standard insurance, it's important to know what your provider's policy limits are for each coverage type.</li>
				
				<li>If you're in the market for a more extensive plan, check how much additional protection each provider can offer. Many carriers can even help you bundle your auto insurance with your home insurance. In that case, it could be advantageous to take a look at some across car insurance quotes as well.</li>
				
				<li>Some shoppers qualify for a discount on their policy's rate. Not every provider awards the same types of discounts, so look for the provider that could potentially offer the most affordable rates according to your circumstances.</li>
