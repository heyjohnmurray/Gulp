			<h1>Home Insurance Rates</h1>
			
			<p>When shopping for homeowners insurance, one of the top things on your mind is probably price. Everybody wants a low rate on their home insurance. Obviously, one of the best ways to secure a low rate is to compare multiple quotes. While you're looking at these numbers, keep in mind that several factors play a part in determining your quotes. Each of these aspects of your home deems you a high- or low-risk customer. Clients who are less likely to file a claim are awarded with lower insurance rates.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Structure:</strong> Not all homes have the same structural integrity. If you have a well-built home, such as a brick house, you might be able to achieve lower rates.</li>
				<li><strong>Upkeep:</strong> Perform regular maintenance and your home is less likely to experience damage.</li>
				<li><strong>Safety installations:</strong> Theft is a covered peril in a standard policy, so you can help lower your rates by installing safety features, such as deadbolts or a home security system.</li>
				<li><strong>Location:</strong> Some parts of the United States are more susceptible to natural disasters than others. Your agent will ask for your address to help determine if you live in a high-risk area. This information will also help determine average repair costs which will be used to calculate your needed dwelling coverage.</li>
			</ul>
