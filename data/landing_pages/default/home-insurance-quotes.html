			<h1>How To Get A Home Insurance Quote</h1>
			
			<p>It's easy to find a great home insurance quote that offers great protection and smart values when you assess your specific coverage needs and compare providers.</p>
						
			<h2>Evaluate your coverage needs</h2>
			
			<p>The first step to getting home insurance quotes is to determine what kind of protection you need for your home and family. It's easy to use an online calculator to estimate the total replacement cost of your home, and a licensed agent will help you refine this number further. That will be the dwelling coverage limit, and once you have it, your agent can explain how limits for some other parts of standard coverage are set as a percentage of this amount. It's also important to ask about additional protection that's not typically included in standard coverage, such as flood policies, umbrella policies and endorsements.</p>
			
			<h2>Compare providers</h2>
			
			<p>Next, compare several providers to find the best policy for your needs. Make sure you're not just comparing price tags - smart shoppers look for the biggest value in a policy. Consider the benefits of working with an unbiased, licensed agent with access to a number of top-rated providers. In a matter of minutes, you'll receive expert advice about how to choose the provider that best fits you.</p>
