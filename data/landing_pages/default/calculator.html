			<h1>Calculator</h1>
			
			<p>Using an online home insurance calculator is really a very easy process. You typically need to know two things about your home - its ZIP code and square footage. Why these factors? When you're calculating home insurance expenses, specifically dwelling coverage, you're determining how much money it would cost to completely rebuild your home in the event of total loss. This dwelling coverage figure is just how much your home is worth - not your house and your piece of property - since your land would still be intact after a disaster such as a fire or hurricane.</p>
			
			<p>The calculation for dwelling coverage isn't quite as simple as counting on your fingers, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to crunch the numbers, either. You need to know your home's square footage; obviously, a larger house would be much more expensive to replace than a more modest one. Also, your ZIP code can help determine average building fees charged by local contractors. What the home insurance calculator does is merely multiply these two numbers and then take into account upgrades. The calculator will give you three figures: one for a modest home, another for a house with a few upgrades and a third estimate for a home that has many special features.</p>
			
			<p>A licensed HomeOwnersInsurance.com agent will help refine the number further and will help make sure you get any discounts you could be eligible to receive.</p>
